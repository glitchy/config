## neovim config
To use my personal config you will need to build the latest `nightly` branch of Neovim from `https://github.com/neovim/neovim`. As of right now the latest stable branch does not have Lua support (check github for updated release notes). Depending on your environment you may need other dependencies as well (e.g. a terminal that supports true color, etc.).

For any help reach out to me (glitchy) on the neovim forum at 'gitter.im/neovim'.

## zshrc

Make sure your shell is `zsh` and place `.zshrc` file in `$HOME` directory. If your terminal is currently open run `source .zshrc`, otherwise simply close and relaunch your terminal to source config file.
