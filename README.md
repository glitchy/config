# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles.

To use my Neovim config you will need to build the latest `nightly` branch from `https://github.com/neovim/neovim`. As of right now the latest stable branch does not have Lua support (check github for updated release notes). Depending on your environment you may need other dependencies as well.

For any help reach out to me (sitkadude) on the neovim forum at 'gitter.im/neovim'.

Enjoy.
