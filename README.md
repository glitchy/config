# neovim config
My personal Neovim config.

To use my config you will need to build the latest `nightly` branch of Neovim from `https://github.com/neovim/neovim`. As of right now the latest stable branch does not have Lua support (check github for updated release notes). Depending on your environment you may need other dependencies as well (e.g. a terminal that supports true color, etc.).

For any help reach out to me (glitchy) on the neovim forum at 'gitter.im/neovim'.

Enjoy.
